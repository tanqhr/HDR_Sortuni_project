faq=Can I post recipes from books or other websites?-\
  You can use recipes from books or other websites, but they must be written by you personally in your own words, and not copied one to one from a book or website. Even if you have a culinary blog with recipes you have already written, in order to add them to us, you must retell them so that the text is not one to one with the original.
